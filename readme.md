## Contents

This repository contains the raw data and scripts for running the analyses presenting in the following manuscript

“Mutations in legume symbiosis genes create a complex selective landscape for rhizobial symbionts”

This
[folder](https://github.com/BurghardtLab/HostMutants2021_C86meliloti)
contains all the raw data, codes used to analyze the results presented
in the manuscript along with the data tables and the figures
(main+supplementary).

The Analysis
[subfolder](https://github.com/BurghardtLab/HostMutants2021_C86meliloti/tree/main/analysis)
includes 2 R markdown files - 
1. Host traits and strain fitness analysis.Rmd : This file has codes for generating Figs 2-3 and 5; Tables S2-S5
2.GWAS_analysis.Rmd : This file has the code used to  generate Fig4 and Fig S2,S5 and Table2,Table S6 and Table S7  in the manuscript.

The Data
[subfolder](https://github.com/BurghardtLab/HostMutants2021_C86meliloti/tree/main/data)
includes the raw data files which have been used to generate the figures and tables

The Figures
[subfolder](https://github.com/BurghardtLab/HostMutants2021_C86meliloti/tree/main/figures)
includes the raw figures whcih were assembled to create the Figures2-5 and Supplementary Figures 1,3,4,5,6.

The Tables
[subfolder](https://github.com/BurghardtLab/HostMutants2021_C86meliloti/tree/main/tables)contains the tables mentioned in the manuscript including 
1.The input (Relative_strainfitness.txt) for visualizing the relative fitness(Fig2E),
2.The input (Mean_strainfitnessshift.txt)for visualizing the strain fitness shifts (Fig 3A) which was the response variable for running the GWAS (Fig3B). 
3.TableS2 is based on information combined from TableS2_genotype.tsv and TableS2_Type.tsv
